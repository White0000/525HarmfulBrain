# Harmful Brain Activity Classification

This repository provides a complete deep learning pipeline for classifying harmful brain activities from EEG signals, such as Seizure, GPD, LRDA, GRDA, or other abnormal patterns. It offers an end-to-end solution, including data loading, preprocessing, model training (CNN/LSTM/Transformer), inference, and 2D/3D visualization.

## Project Overview

The **Harmful Brain Activity Classification** project aims to identify various EEG abnormalities in a hospital or research context (e.g., ICU). Common target classes include:
- **Seizure**
- **GPD/LPD** (Generalized or Lateralized Periodic Discharges)
- **LRDA/GRDA** (Lateralized or Generalized Rhythmic Delta Activity)
- **Other**  

We unify these into numerical labels, train neural networks (CNN, LSTM, Transformer), and achieve high accuracy and near-perfect AUC on large EEG datasets.

## Key Features

1. **Flexible DataLoader**: Easily load EEG CSV with multiple numeric columns (offsets, votes, etc.) and label columns (expert_consensus or derived from votes).
2. **Optional Preprocessing**: GUI-based filtering (bandpass, wavelet, notch), segmentation, saving processed CSV.
3. **Modular Models**: Choose from:
   - **Linear** (simple baseline)
   - **CNN** (2D residual + attention blocks + mini-Transformer)
   - **LSTM** (with multi-head self-attention)
   - **Transformer** (positional encoding, multi-layer encoder)
4. **Training Pipeline**:
   - PyTorch-based training loop
   - Live logging of each epochâ€™s loss & accuracy
   - Automatic saving of the full model (for easy `torch.load(...)`)
5. **Inference Pipeline**:
   - Load model `.pth`, load inference CSV
   - Run predictions, print classification report, confusion matrix, AUC
   - Optionally save predictions
6. **Visualization**:
   - **2D**: Plot CSV columns (line/scatter/bar) with overlay Y2
   - **3D**: View 3D point cloud in Open3D (downsample, remove outliers, color, etc.)
